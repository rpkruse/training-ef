# Entity Framwork Core Training Project

This project was created to allow people to learn Entity Framework. It is connected to [Heroku](https://ef-learning-project.herokuapp.com) to allow users to practice modifying a real database, release/deploy new features, and create pull requests to mimic real life situations.
